## Why Threat Hunting Matters

Reactive security is dead. Advanced attackers live undetected for **months**.

| Current Reality                  | Proactive Advantage                          |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Alert overload & noise           | Find threats before impact                    |
| Tool sprawl & blind spots        | Unified visibility + automation               |
| Drowning in logs                 | Hunt with context, trends, and intelligence   |

**Benefits**:
- Catch APTs & zero-days early
- Fix hygiene issues before exploitation
- Reduce false positives
- Prove ROI with real findings
- Speak risk in leadership language

<br>

## Types of Threat Hunting

| Type                        | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Baselining**              | Map normal behavior → instantly spot anomalies                              |
| **IOC-Based (Retro)**       | Search historical data for known indicators (hashes, IPs, domains)         |
| **TTP-Based (MITRE ATT&CK)**| Hunt by adversary tactics: credential dumping, lateral movement, etc.       |

**Pro Tip**: Always start with baselining. You can’t hunt what you don’t understand.

<br>

## Prerequisites for Success

You need these before your first hunt:
- Complete, high-fidelity logging (EDR, Windows Events, network, cloud)
- Data aggregation & normalization
- Threat intelligence + anomaly detection
- Executive sponsorship and clear goals

<br>

## The 5-Step Threat Hunting Framework

1. **Define Your Hypothesis**  
   → “Find low-and-slow credential attacks” or “Detect Kerberoasting”
2. **Collect Long-Term Trending Data** (30–90 days)  
   → Stealthy attackers hide in trends
3. **Execute the Hunt & Investigate**
4. **Find & Fix Hygiene Issues**  
   → Abnormal accounts, weak protocols, over-privileged users
5. **Close Detection Gaps**  
   → Turn findings into new rules, alerts, and defenses

**Then repeat** — each hunt makes the next one faster and sharper.

## Measure Success (And Keep the Budget Coming)

| Metric                        | Why It Matters                     |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Hunts executed                | Shows consistent activity         |
| % of environment covered      | Proves breadth                     |
| Threats found & remediated    | Real business impact               |
| Detection rules improved      | Long-term maturity                 |

Clear metrics = continued funding and leadership trust.

One platform that lets you:
- Aggregate & normalize logs from everywhere
- Run hypothesis-driven, iterative hunts
- Visualize normal vs. abnormal behavior
- Kill noise and focus on real threats

**Automation + AI = More time for defenders. Less for attackers.**

<br>

## Key Takeaways

- Stop reacting. **Start hunting.**
- Baseline first. Hunt second.
- Every hunt needs a clear hypothesis.
- Automate or lose the war.
- Measure everything.
- Iterate forever.

> **Threat hunting doesn’t just find evil — it makes your entire security program elite.**
